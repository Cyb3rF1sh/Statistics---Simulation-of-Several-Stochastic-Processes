# Statistics---Simulation-of-Several-Stochastic-Processes

In this project, I ventured into the fascinating world of stochastic processes, which are sequences of random events characterized by specific probabilistic properties. 
A stochastic process, inherently unpredictable, is a fundamental concept in various fields like finance, physics, and beyond, offering a mathematical framework for modeling time-evolving random phenomena.

I have successfully simulated several renowned stochastic processes, including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, Hull-White, and Black-Karasinski models, each with significant applications in financial modeling, 
particularly in interest rate dynamics. These were implemented in JavaScript, with each class specifically designed to generate stochastic trajectories based on their unique mathematical formulations.
